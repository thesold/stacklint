All stacks use `lintstaged` to run all linted stacks when code is commited to the git repository. We feel that this is a really nice approach to avoid un-linted code creeping into the codebase.

Because standard lint configuration files are used any related Code-editor plugins should pickup and follow the same ruleset, or when running individual linters directly.

When running `stacklint` all node and composer packages required to lint the selected stacks are added to your configuration files and individual config files for each stack are also included.

## Installation

Stacklint is intended to be installed globally so that it can easily be run and there is no need to include the dependency in your project specific package.json.

```sh
npm install -g stacklint
```

## Usage

```sh
stacklint [options] <stacks>
```

After installing your lint stacks you will need to run required installs.

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
composer install
```

## Examples

The following example will setup all required files and packages to lint `php` and `md` Markdown files when they are committed to git.

```sh
stacklint php md json
```

Installs packages and configs for:

1. Lintstaged
1. PHP Codesniffer
1. Markdownlint
1. Jsonlint

## Available stacks

You can quickly check which stacks are available by running `stacklint -l` or `stacklint --list`.

1. js (Javascript. Also required additional stack for style guide. E.g. `airbnb`)
    1. airbnb (Airbnb style guide)
1. json
1. laravel (Use instead of `php` if using laravel)
1. md (Markdown)
1. php (PSR-2)
1. scss
1. vue (Requires `js` stack)
